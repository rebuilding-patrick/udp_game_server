Barebones working server. Probably going to stay in this state for a long time as I don't want to develop on UDP at the moment. 
Features four threads, one for network input, one for network output, one for game logic, and a postman to go between them. 
Like the design so I'm sharing it/saving it for later when I need to start work on something with faster network demands than TCP can deliver.
