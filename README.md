Barebones working server. Probably going to stay in this state for a long time as I don't want to develop on UDP at the moment. 
Features three threads, one for network input, one for network output, and one for game logic. 
Like the design so I'm sharing it/saving it for later when I need to start work on something with faster network demands than TCP can deliver.
